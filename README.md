# Usage
## As a CLI

`amjwt` can be used as a CLI. You can provide the key and team IDs via the `-k` and `-t` flags respectively. `-f` can be used to specify the path to the private key file.
```
amjwt -k <key-id> -t <team-id> -f ./MyPrivateKey.p8
```

You can also pipe the private key in if necessary:
```
cat ./MyPrivateKey.p8 | amjwt -k <key-id> -t <team-id>
```

## As a Package

You can also import amjwt as a go package:
```go
import "github.com/yukitsune/amjwt"
keyId := "foo"
teamId := "bar"
privateKeyBytes, err = ioutil.ReadFile("./somewhere/MyPrivateKey.p8")
jwtString, err := amjwt.CreateJwt(keyId, teamId, expiryDays, privateKeyBytes)
```

# But... Why?
Because for some reason, Apple wants you to hand craft the JWT to authenticate with the Apple Music API. ü§∑‚Äç
